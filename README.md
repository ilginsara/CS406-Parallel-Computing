The problem is finding the number of length k cycles containing the vertex u for each u in vertex set V, given an undirected graph G=(V,E), and a positive integer 2<k<6. If the length k is taken as an input and not known because of it, the problem becomes NP-complete but in this project, the cycle length k is given, so the problem can be solved in either O(VE) time.
